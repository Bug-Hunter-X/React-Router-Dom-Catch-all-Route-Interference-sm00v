# React Router DOM Catch-all Route Interference

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route (`*`) in `react-router-dom`.  The catch-all route, intended to handle 404 errors, can unexpectedly interfere with other routes if not placed correctly.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` demonstrates a scenario where navigation to `/about` (or any other specific route) fails because the catch-all route (`/*`) is inappropriately positioned, capturing all routes before specific routes have a chance to match. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by ensuring that the catch-all route (`/*`) is placed as the *last* route in the `Routes` component. This ensures that specific routes are matched before the catch-all route handles unmatched paths.
